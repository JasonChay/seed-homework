// double slashes are for single line comments

// TODO: Do the following instructions in your Git Bash - no cheating by using your interface!
// 1. Create a directory in your desktop named seed-homeworks
// 2. Inside that directory, create a directory named hw1
// 3. Go into hw1 and create a file called hw1.js
// 4. Go back to seed-homeworks and create another directory named tmp
// 5. Go into tmp and make a file called tmp.txt and another file called tmp2.txt
// 6. Open up tmp2.txt using Notepad and type in "Goodbye cruel world!".
// 7. Close Notepad and print out the contents to the screen.
// 8. Delete tmp.txt
// 9. Go back to seed-homeworks and remove the tmp directory as a whole

// TODO: Predict the output of the following console log lines.
// You can uncomment the lines by removing the double slash
// After uncommenting, you can then run this file to see the output

// Here is an example
// console.log(5 + 5);
// 10

// console.log(3 + 2 * 4);

// console.log(10 > 10);

// console.log(1 / 2);

// console.log("Dragon" > "Knight");

// console.log(12 % 7);

// console.log(3 < 3 ? "A" : "B");

// console.log("Bob" + "Mary"); // Is there a space between them or not?

// console.log("Bob","Mary"); // I didn't talk about comma, but you might be able to guess

// console.log("Is this a new
// 		line");

// console.log("The fox\njumped over the fence");

// console.log(typeof (3 > 2));

// console.log(typeof "Bob");

// console.log(typeof Infinity);

// console.log(typeof NaN);

// console.log(typeof undefined);

// TODO: Using Atom, open hw1.js in the seed-homeworks directory. You can open up the folder in your desktop and right click the file to open with Atom.

// Write from scratch (try not to refer to notes) the output of 17 to the 3rd power.

// Write to the console a message that looks like the following:
// You have to use '\n'
// to make a new line
// NOTE: The above should be shown as two separate lines! Remember how to escape for this!

// OPTIONAL TODO:
// Create your own Github repository and experiment with Git by yourself!
// Here are the commands you will need:
// git status, git clone, git add, git commit, git push, git pull

// Optional TODO:
// Learn Vim, the editor for professionals :P
// Use vimtutor or one of the thousands of tutorials online
// I highly recommend it as an alternative to other text editors

// Optional TODO:
// Read the first chapter of Eloquent Javascript
// Online version is free!
